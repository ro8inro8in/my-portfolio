		<h2>ABOUT ME!</h2>
		<p>I am a freelance audio editor, my experience in the music industry spans over ten years.

			To begin with, my Dad taught me how to play guitar, later I moved on to college to further my education
			in
			musical composition. When I finished college I went on to university, I moved my focus to music
			production
			and sound engineering.

			I have worked on many projects in various aspects utilising all my skills with a main focus on live
			performance and production, This continued to evolve year after year until recently where I spent two
			years
			touring around Europe, unfortunately to the demise of the band we all stopped.

			That brings me to now where I am a working as a freelance Audio editor.

		<h2>WHY CODE?</h2>
		<p> I have always been fascinated with code and just never understood how anybody could read and follow
			what was going on, It was impressive to me, I have thought of my self to not be intelligent
			enough academically to learn something so complex. I am blessed with Dyslexia and Dyspraxia
			and I have always thought that this would hold me back, one part of this is the challenge to my self
			another part of this is
			being
			tired of working random jobs that lead to nothing and instability as a freelancer.
