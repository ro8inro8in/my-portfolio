		<h2>ABOUT ME!</h2>
		<p>Hi, I am a musician. When I was roughly 12 years old, my Dad taught me how to play the Guitar. I persued this threw out
			high school and moved on to college where I furthered my education
			in
			musical composition. When I finished college I went on to university and moved my focus into music
			production.<br><br>

			I have worked on many projects in various aspects utilising all my skills with a focus on
			performance and audio production, This has evolved year after year until recently where I spent two
			years
			touring around Europe, unfortunately to the demise of the band, we all stopped performing.

			That brings me to now where I am working as a freelance Audio editor.

		<h2>WHY CODE?</h2>
		<p> I have always been fascinated with code and just never understood how anybody could read and follow
			what was going on, It was impressive to me, I have thought of my self to not be intelligent
			enough academically to learn something so complex.<br><br> I am blessed with Dyslexia and Dyspraxia.
			I have always thought that this would hold me back. I am learning to code to challenge my self, explore new
			creative ways of thinking. I am 

			tired of working random jobs that lead to nothing and instability as a freelancer.
